# File_handling-in-C
Repo here to learn and exhibit how to handle files, perform operations and end with a basic project as as well in C programming language
Here, we'll do basic actions like creating files, writing data into them and so on... Then at the end, we'll hopefully have mastered enough to partake in a self created project which should perform a task, and hopefully solve a problem.
  Fell free to clone and make basic changes to your personal copy. Heck, improve my methods and just play around, and even impress me :)
